description: An essential text for understanding Socrates, Xenophon's Memorabilia
  is the compelling tribute of an affectionate student to his teacher, providing a
  rare firsthand account of Socrates' life and philosophy. The Memorabilia is invaluable
  both as a work of philosophy in its own right and as a complement to the study of
  Plato's dialogues. The longest of Xenophon's four Socratic works, it is particularly
  revealing about the differences between Socrates and his philosophical predecessors.
